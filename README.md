# Flowdepth — crypto order flow, below the surface

> Flowdepth is an open-source native desktop terminal for crypto order flow and options analytics, built in Rust as an advanced fork of Flowsurface.

Flowdepth combines crypto order-flow charts with footprint and L2 heatmap views, adaptive volume bubbles, Binance iceberg/replenishment detection, Deribit GEX, and Derive observed maker flow. A persistent market-data cache, automatic reconnect, and historical gap recovery help charts remain useful through longer sessions and network interruptions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Beta status:** Flowdepth is experimental but usable beta software and is evolving quickly. Back up important layouts before updating. Beta releases may contain regressions.
> Flowdepth is derived from and continues to credit the upstream [Flowsurface](https://github.com/flowsurface-rs/flowsurface) project.

## Why Flowdepth?

Flowdepth extends Flowsurface for traders and market observers who want deeper crypto order-flow tooling in a native desktop application. Its development focuses on richer execution and liquidity visualization, resilient market-data ingestion and recovery, and crypto-options analytics while preserving the open-source Rust foundation of the upstream project.

Detection and analytics such as possible iceberg activity, GEX, and observed maker flow describe market data; they are not certain trading signals.

## Download

Automated beta builds are available from the [Flowdepth Releases page](https://github.com/Niketion/flowdepth/releases). They are generated from the `develop` branch after the full quality gate succeeds.

For a quick start:

1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/Niketion/flowdepth/releases).
2. Download the package for your platform: Windows x64, Linux x64, or universal macOS.
3. Extract the archive.
4. Run `flowsurface.exe` on Windows or the `flowsurface` binary on Linux/macOS.

The application binary and Rust package are currently still named `flowsurface` for upstream compatibility.

Windows and macOS beta binaries are not currently signed. Windows SmartScreen may require **More info → Run anyway**. On macOS, control-click the binary and choose **Open**, or allow it under **System Settings → Privacy & Security**.

### Release channels

- **Beta builds:** automated builds from `develop`, published as GitHub prereleases after formatting, check, Clippy, tests, and all platform packages succeed. Tags use `develop-<commit>`, where `<commit>` is the seven-character Git commit identifier used for the build.
- **Stable releases:** not currently available.

## Key features

- **Order-flow charts:** footprint views, historical L2 heatmaps, Time & Sales, DOM/ladder, candlesticks, comparisons, volume profiles, and cumulative volume delta.
- **Adaptive volume bubbles:** configurable clustering of aggressive executions with adaptive thresholds, side/delta coloring, bounded labels, and stable live updates.
- **Possible Binance iceberg/replenishment detection:** optional markers for evidence of passive absorption on Binance USDⓈ-M perpetuals. The detector is probabilistic, disabled by default, and does not prove that an exchange-native iceberg order exists.
- **Crypto options analytics:** BTC and ETH GEX profiles sourced from Deribit, plus independently displayed Derive observed maker flow matched to Deribit contracts.
- **Persistent market-data cache:** local storage for klines, open interest, trades, and derived bubble summaries with gap detection, deduplication, and invalidation.
- **Connection recovery:** automatic reconnect, historical gap backfill, bounded retries, stale-request cancellation, and sequence-aware recovery.
- **Workspace tools:** persistent layouts, saved-state recovery, customizable themes, pane linking, loading/coverage feedback, and an in-app debug terminal.
- **Public market data:** market data is received directly from exchange REST APIs and WebSockets. Current features do not require exchange trading credentials.

### Historical trades on footprint charts

Live trades are captured over WebSocket. Binance charts can optionally backfill the visible range from [data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision/) daily files, the paginated REST API, or both. Historical trade fetching for Bybit and Hyperliquid is not available; OKX support remains work in progress.

## Installation

### Prebuilt beta packages

Follow the [quick-start download steps](#download). Packages contain the application binary and the assets needed by that platform.

### Build from source

Requirements:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install); the pinned version and components are defined in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- Platform dependencies:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libasound2-dev`
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S base-devel alsa-lib`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc make alsa-lib-devel`
  - macOS: install Xcode Command Line Tools with `xcode-select --install`.
  - Windows: use a Rust MSVC toolchain; no additional project dependency is required.

Install directly from the `develop` branch:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/Niketion/flowdepth.git --branch develop flowsurface
flowsurface
```

Or clone, build, and run the repository:

```bash
git clone --branch develop https://github.com/Niketion/flowdepth.git
cd flowdepth
cargo build --release --locked
cargo run --release --locked
```

The application binary and Rust package are currently still named `flowsurface` for upstream compatibility. The public project and fork are named Flowdepth; internal crate and module names intentionally retain their upstream-compatible names.

### Notable changes from `upstream/main`

The `develop` branch adds the order-flow, options, caching, recovery, diagnostics, saved-state, and build automation features summarized above. Windows uses a single-native-window compatibility mode to avoid an upstream multi-window redraw issue, while macOS and Linux retain native multi-window behavior.

## Project relationship

Flowdepth is a fork of [Flowsurface](https://github.com/flowsurface-rs/flowsurface). It retains upstream compatibility and attribution and does not seek to obscure or replace the origin of its code. Flowdepth-specific features are developed independently, and Flowdepth releases and support are separate from official Flowsurface releases.

The Rust package and executable remain named `flowsurface` for compatibility. Changes can be reviewed directly in the [`upstream/main...develop` comparison](https://github.com/flowsurface-rs/flowsurface/compare/main...Niketion:develop).
